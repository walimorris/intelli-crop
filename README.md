# Intelli-Crop
***
## High Level Overview
Intelli-Crop is a web application that uses machine learning and facial recognition to intelligently 
crop images to a fine-tuned headshot proportion. This can be expanded in many ways such as social media 
images, entertainment platforms, thumbnails, e-commerce, facial recognition and other machine learning algorithms. 

How easy is it to implement an ML solution which uses facial recognition? Further, what can such technologies 
be used for, in both malicious and positive ways? Why would any entity want to recognize any person's face,
what can that recognized image be used for, what is the limit to such technologies and how are such 
technologies being used today? Of course, this brings up many questions and this small solution is a simple 
way of exploring such technologies, it's limitations and use-cases for positive means.

Here are the technologies used in this project (this may expand in the future): 
* [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) Implement secure, frictionless customer identity and access
management that scales
* [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) Build full-stack web and mobile apps in hours
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) Object Storage built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere
* [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) Run code without thinking about servers or clusters
* [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) Visual workflows for distributed applications
* [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) Automate your image and video analysis with machine learning
* [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) Fast, flexible NoSQL database service for single digit millisecond
performance at any scale
* [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) Securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds
